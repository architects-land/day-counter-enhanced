# Day Counter Enhanced
Day Counter Enhanced counts day for you!

With this, you can see the time spent with the mod installed directly on your screen.
It is useful when you do a “100 days” challenge (e.g., surviving 100 days in hardcore).

I made this mod because others don't support servers or must be installed on the client *and* on the server.

Client-side mod made for Fabric using the Fabric API.
